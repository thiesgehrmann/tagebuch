But surely, you impatiently protest, there must be something good amidst all this shambles, something that calls for sweet shambles words: and you are right.
But that something is the short trio of short plays by Saroyan and O'Casey produced by Eddie Dowling under the group title, Life, laughter and tears.
Here, in this worst of all possible theatrical seasons, is up to the hour of reporting the one and only honestly meritorious and stimulating dramatic evening.
(In Time to come had its points, but there were not enough of them.)
The first item on the bill is O'Casey's uproarious farce, the End of The Beginning, which I described in these pages some time ago upon reading the manuscript and which, dealing with the tribulation of repair of Irish nitwits who try to run a household from which the wife of one of them had departed in pique, is one of the most hilarious roughhouses within late memory.
The second item is Saroyan's Hello Out There.
